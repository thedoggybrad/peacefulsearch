For purposes of the Terms of Use, "Site" shall mean the Web site or sites on which You place JavaScript or similar programming ("Code") which renders the Google search box (or other means used by users of the Site ("End Users") to enter a search query ("Query")) on the Site ("Search Box"). All Queries sent from the Site to Google shall comply with the technical specifications that Google may provide from time to time, and and must originate from the Site. Google will receive Queries from You at Google's network interface, process the Queries using Google's search engine and display search results ("Results") on a Results Page. For purposes of the Terms of Use, "Results Page" is defined as the Google hosted or controlled Web page that contains and displays to an End User the Results from the Service.

The Results displayed by the Service will be determined by some or all of the following: (a) the web sites over which the search is to be restricted or filtered, as provided by you in the Service; (b) labels created by You; or (c) other Service features that Google may make available from time to time as described in the Service documentation, which can be found at http://www.google.com/support/customsearch/bin/answer.py?answer=1714300 or other URL that Google may make available from time to time at its sole discretion.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Service may be modified or terminated at any time by Google for any reason, and without notice, without liability to You, any End User or any third party. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Use.

1.2 Modifications. Google may modify the Terms of Use at any time with or without notice, and you can review the most current version of the Terms of Use online at any time at Terms of Use. If a modification is unacceptable to You, You may cancel the Service on the Site and terminate the Terms of Use by removing the Code and the Search Box from Your Site. If You continue to use the Code and/or the Search Box on any Site, You will be deemed to have accepted the modifications.

1.3 Your Obligations. You shall receive a Query from the End User and shall forward that Query to Google. You may not in any way frame, cache or modify the Results produced by Google, except as otherwise agreed to between You and Google. Google will not be responsible for receiving Queries from End Users or for transmission of data between You and Google's network interface. You shall be responsible for providing all hardware and software required to perform Your obligations under the Terms of Use, including but not limited to the following: (a) implementing and maintaining the Site, (b) implementing and maintaining the interface between the Site and the Service, and (c) receiving a Query from an End User and transmitting the Query to Google.

1.4 Appropriate Conduct. You shall not, and shall not allow any third party to: (a) edit, modify, truncate, filter or change the order of the information contained in any Results (either individually or collectively), including, without limitation, by way of commingling Results with non-Google provided search results or advertising; (b) frame any Results or Results Page except as provided for in the Service documentation; (c) display any Results in pop-up, pop-under, exit windows, expanding buttons, or animation; (d) display any Results to any third parties other than End Users; (e) minimize, remove or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any Results Page (including any Results); (f) directly or indirectly access, launch and/or activate the Service through or from, or otherwise incorporate the Service in, any Web site or other means other than the Site, and then only to the extent expressly permitted herein; (g) transfer, sell, lease, syndicate, sub-syndicate, lend, or use for co-branding, timesharing, service bureau or other unauthorized purposes any Service or access thereto (including, but not limited to Results, or any part, copy or derivative thereof); (h) enter into any arrangement or agreement under which any third party pays You fees for the usage of the Service, You pay any third party feesfor the usage of the Service, or either shares in any revenue payments and/or royalties for any Results; (i) directly or indirectly generate queries, or impressions of or clicks on Results, through any automated, deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid means (including, but not limited to, click spam, robots, macro programs, and Internet agents); (j) modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from any Service or any other Google technology, content, data, routines, algorithms, methods, ideas design, user interface techniques, software, materials, and documentation; (k) remove, deface, obscure, or alter Google's copyright notice, trademarks or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or provided as a part of any Service or any other Google technology, software, materials and documentation; (l) "crawl", "spider", index or in any non-transitory manner store or cache information obtained from the Service (including, but not limited to, Results, or any part, copy or derivative thereof); (m) create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product through use of or access to any of the Service or proprietary information related thereto; and/or (n) engage in any action or practice that reflects poorly on Google or otherwise disparages or devalues Google's reputation or goodwill.

7.1 Term. The term of the Terms of Use (the "Term") shall commence on the date upon which You add Code to Your Site and shall continue in force thereafter, unless terminated as provided herein.

In addition, either party may terminate the Terms of Use at any time, for any reason, or for no reason including, but not limited to, if You engage in any action that reflects poorly on Google or otherwise disparages or devalues the Google Brand Features or Google's reputation or goodwill.

7.6 Remedies. You acknowledge that Your breach of service/license restrictions contained herein may cause irreparable harm to Google, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, You agree that, in addition to any other remedies to which Google may be legally entitled, Google shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of a breach of such sections by You or any of Your officers, employees, consultants or other agents.

8. Miscellaneous. Each party will comply with all laws, rules and regulations, if any, applicable to it in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement. All notices will be in English and in writing and (a) if sent to You: to the address You may have previously indicated and (b) if sent to Google to: Google Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043. Notice will be deemed given (i) upon receipt when delivered personally, (ii) upon written verification of receipt from overnight courier, (iii) upon verification of receipt of registered or certified mail or (iv) upon verification of receipt via facsimile, provided that such notice is also sent simultaneously via first class mail. You will not assign or otherwise transfer Your rights or delegate Your obligations under the Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Google; and any attempt to do so will be null and void. Any assignment or other transfer of rights or delegation by You shall not operate to relieve You of Your responsibilities under this Terms of Use. You will require Your assignees, transferees, or delegates to agree, in writing, to the terms and conditions of this Terms of Use. This Terms of Use and any claim or dispute of whatever nature arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and applicable federal U.S laws, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would require the application of the laws of a different state. Each party agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties specifically exclude from application to the Terms of Use the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. The Terms of Use supersedes any other prior or collateral agreements, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any amendments or modifications to the Terms of Use must (i) be in writing; (ii) refer to the Terms of Use; and (iii) be executed by an authorized representative of each party. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect a party's right to require performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver of a breach of any provision constitute a waiver of the provision itself. If any provision is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, invalid or otherwise contrary to law, such provision will be interpreted so as to best accomplish its intended objectives and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The parties hereto are and will remain independent contractors and nothing herein will be deemed to create any agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between the parties. Neither party will be deemed to be an employee or legal representative of the other nor will either party have any right or authority to create any obligation on behalf of the other party. Neither party will be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations (except for the payment of money) resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances. The Terms of Use is not intended to benefit, nor will it be deemed to give rise to, any rights in any third party. The Terms of Use will be binding on and inure to the benefit of each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. THE TERMS OF USE CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THE TERMS OF USE SUPERSEDE, AND THE TERMS OF THE TERMS OF USE GOVERN, ANY OTHER PRIOR OR COLLATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
