## How this thing works?
This search engine is composed by 2 components:
<br>
•The Search Engine
<br>
•Graphical User Interface
<br>
<br>
The Search Engine is powered by Google's Programmable Search Engine running HTML and JavaScript. While, the Graphical User Interface was running under HTML and CSS, that is powered by Jekyll's Cayman Theme.
<br>
<br>
This means that everything you type and search is sent to Google. The search results are also from Google.

## Use of CDN
Critical files (CSS, JS and Favicon/Logo) is now using jsDelivr's CDN. This is done to provide a better experience to the end users.

## How to use?
1.) Go to the search engine thru the "Official Links".
<br>
2.) Click the search bar and type whatever you want to search.
<br>
3.) Click the search button and wait for the results to appear.
<br>
4.) Browse the search results. You may also choose between "Web" and "Image" results.
